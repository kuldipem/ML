# Important Definitions in Machine Learning

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **[Artificial Intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)** | AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. |
| **[Machine Learning (ML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)** | ML is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. |
